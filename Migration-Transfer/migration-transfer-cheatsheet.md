- Start DataSync task: `aws datasync start-task-execution --task-arn <arn>`

## Console Tips
- Use Migration Hub to track all migrations
- Monitor DMS task status and logs for errors
- Use DataSync scheduling for recurring transfers

## Best Practices
- Test migrations in a non-production environment first
- Use continuous replication for minimal downtime
- Validate data integrity after migration
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest

## Troubleshooting
- Check CloudWatch logs for migration errors
- Monitor task progress in Migration Hub
