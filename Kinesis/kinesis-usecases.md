# AWS Kinesis â€“ Use Cases

## 1. Real-Time Data Analytics
- **Scenario:** Ingest and analyze streaming data from IoT devices, logs, or clickstreams.
- **Best Practice:** Use Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL-based real-time analytics.

## 2. Log and Event Processing
- **Scenario:** Collect and process application logs or events in real time.
- **Best Practice:** Use Kinesis Data Firehose to deliver data to S3, Redshift, or Elasticsearch.

## 3. Data Lake Ingestion
- **Scenario:** Stream data into a data lake for batch and real-time processing.
- **Best Practice:** Use partition keys for even data distribution and scaling.

## 4. Machine Learning Pipelines
- **Scenario:** Feed real-time data into ML models for fraud detection, recommendations, etc.
- **Best Practice:** Integrate with Lambda for preprocessing and SageMaker for inference.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Scenario:** Monitor application or infrastructure metrics in real time.
- **Best Practice:** Use Kinesis Data Streams with Lambda for custom alerting.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Monitor shard count and adjust for scaling.
- Use enhanced fan-out for high-throughput consumers.
- Check for data retention and processing delays.
