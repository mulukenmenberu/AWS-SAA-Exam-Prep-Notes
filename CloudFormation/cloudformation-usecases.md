# AWS CloudFormation â€“ Use Cases

## 1. Multi-Environment Deployment
- **Scenario:** Deploy identical dev, test, and prod environments with a single template.
- **Best Practice:** Use parameters for environment-specific values (e.g., instance type, subnet IDs).

## 2. Automated Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Scenario:** Launch a complete VPC, EC2, RDS, and S3 setup for a new application in minutes.
- **Best Practice:** Use nested stacks to organize large templates and outputs to share values between stacks.

## 3. Disaster Recovery
- **Scenario:** Quickly recreate your entire infrastructure in another region for DR.
- **Best Practice:** Store templates in version control and use StackSets for cross-region deployment.

## 4. Compliance and Auditing
- **Scenario:** Ensure all resources are created according to company policy and are auditable.
- **Best Practice:** Use tags, outputs, and AWS Config integration for compliance tracking.

## 5. CI/CD Integration
- **Scenario:** Automate infrastructure changes as part of your deployment pipeline.
- **Best Practice:** Integrate CloudFormation with CodePipeline or other CI/CD tools for automated, repeatable deployments.

## 6. Cost Management
- **Scenario:** Tear down test environments automatically to save costs.
- **Best Practice:** Use stack deletion to remove all resources at once and avoid orphaned resources.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Always check the "Events" tab for errors and progress.
- Use change sets to preview updates and avoid accidental changes.
- Use drift detection to find resources changed outside CloudFormation.
- If a stack fails, review error messages and roll back if needed.
