# AWS Systems Manager (SSM) â€“ Use Cases

## 1. Automated Patching
- **Scenario:** Keep hundreds of EC2/on-premises servers up to date with OS and software patches.
- **Best Practice:** Use Patch Manager with maintenance windows and compliance reporting.

## 2. Secure Remote Management
- **Scenario:** Run commands or scripts on instances without SSH or RDP.
- **Best Practice:** Use Run Command and Session Manager for secure, auditable access.

## 3. Configuration Management
- **Scenario:** Enforce consistent configuration across all servers (e.g., install agents, set registry keys).
- **Best Practice:** Use State Manager to apply and maintain desired state.

## 4. Secrets and Configuration Storage
- **Scenario:** Store and retrieve database passwords, API keys, and app config securely.
- **Best Practice:** Use Parameter Store with encryption and access control.

## 5. Inventory and Compliance
- **Scenario:** Track installed software, patch status, and configuration drift across your fleet.
- **Best Practice:** Use Inventory and Compliance dashboards for reporting and alerts.

## 6. Automated Deployments
- **Scenario:** Deploy applications or updates to multiple servers automatically.
- **Best Practice:** Use Automation documents and integrate with CodePipeline for CI/CD.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If an instance is not managed, check SSM Agent status and IAM role.
- For command failures, review output/logs in the console.
- Use CloudWatch and AWS Config for compliance and monitoring.
- Use Session Manager for troubleshooting without opening SSH ports.
