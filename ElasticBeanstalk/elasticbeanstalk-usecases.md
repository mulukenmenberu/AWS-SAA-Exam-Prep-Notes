# AWS Elastic Beanstalk â€“ Use Cases

## 1. Rapid Web Application Deployment
- **Scenario:** Deploy web applications (Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, etc.) quickly without managing infrastructure.
- **Best Practice:** Use environment configuration files for repeatable deployments.

## 2. Blue/Green Deployments
- **Scenario:** Minimize downtime and risk during application updates by deploying new environments alongside existing ones.
- **Best Practice:** Use Elastic Beanstalk's built-in blue/green deployment support.

## 3. Auto Scaling and Load Balancing
- **Scenario:** Automatically scale applications based on demand and distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- **Best Practice:** Enable auto scaling and configure health checks for high availability.

## 4. Multi-Environment Management
- **Scenario:** Manage separate environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Best Practice:** Use environment cloning and configuration templates.

## 5. Hybrid Architectures
- **Scenario:** Integrate Elastic Beanstalk with other AWS services (RDS, S3, SQS, etc.) for complex solutions.
- **Best Practice:** Use environment variables and IAM roles for secure integration.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Check environment health and logs in the Elastic Beanstalk console.
- Use enhanced health reporting for detailed diagnostics.
- Monitor deployments with CloudWatch metrics and alarms.
